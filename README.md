Task MemorizeIt
===============

This is just a small single page TODO app to learn a bit about Backbone and PhoneGap.
I'd like to make a todo list, with different kind of tasks and later I'd like to add the server side too.

There are 3 different kine of notes:

- Task
- Todo
- Note


Task
-----
Just a simple and sort text.

Todo
-----
This is a simple text too, but it stores the status. (True/false, complete or not.)

Note
-----
The note is a bit longer stuff, with a title and body.
